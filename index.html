      <h2>Hello, I'm Ryanne Russell.</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I am currently an undergraduate in the Computer Science
        major at Texas Tech University. On this website, you will find
        my recent projects, resume, and some additional information that might
        interest you. My goal after I graduate in May of 2027 is to expand upon my Software Development
        skills and blank. I am extremely dedicated to expanding my expertise and to helping others solve problems.
        In my free time, I love to work on personal passion projects, hike, rockclimb, and spend time with family and friends.
